            The history of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) begins with its proposal by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 while he was working at CERN. The need for a style sheet language arose as the World Wide Web evolved beyond a simple document-sharing platform for researchers, and the desire for visually appealing and structured web pages grew.
            <h3 style="color: rgb(236, 72, 26);">Key milestones in CSS history include:</h3>
            <h4>1994:</h4>
            <mark>Håkon Wium Lie proposes the concept of CSS.</mark>
            <h4>1996:</h4>
            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes the first official CSS specification, CSS Level 1 (CSS1), co-authored by Lie and Bert Bos.
            <h4>1998:</h4>
            CSS Level 2 (CSS2) is released as a W3C Recommendation, introducing new features like absolute and relative positioning, z-index, media types, and enhanced font properties.
            <h4>1999 onwards:</h4>
            Work on CSS Level 3 (CSS3) begins. Unlike previous versions, CSS3 is developed as a collection of modular specifications, allowing for independent development and implementation of new features, such as new layout models (Flexbox, Grid), transitions, and transformations. This modular approach enables continuous evolution and adoption of CSS features.
            Throughout its history, CSS has evolved to address the increasing demands of web design, moving from basic styling capabilities to powerful layout and animation features, while maintaining backward compatibility.
